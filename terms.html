        <h2>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration</h2>
        <p>You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Metron will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with this section, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Metron are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
